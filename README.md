# Convolutional Neural Network Testing on CIFAR 10 Dataset 
This is the GitHub repository for my WI2025 COGS181 project on conventional neural networks on image sets.

# Testing across various implementations on CNN
The project itself tackles the problem of convolutional neural networks and their ability to correctly identify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. Within the project, several implementations and changes will be looked and recorded to best find the best hyper-parameters across the various implmentations on the CNN (i.e., number of layers, the pooling functions, optimization methods, different activation functions).

The first test will look at a standard CNN architecture I will build versus one from PyTorch that is meant to resemble AlexNet.

The next four tests will go back to my original CNN I used, and implement various changes. They include:

1.) Varying layers

2.) Different optimization methods (Adam v. stochastic gradient descent)

3.) Different pooling functions (average pooling, max pooling, stochastic pooling)

4.) Different activation functions (ReLu, Sigmoid)

My project involves the use of Python and several of its libraries (PyTorch, NumPy, Matplotlib).
